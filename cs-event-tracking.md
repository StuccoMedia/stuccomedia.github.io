# Client Side Event Tracking #

Client side event tracking provides an easy way for you to pass information of user actions to Stucco. This information is used to optimize the traffic we deliver to you, and so it's important to make sure the integration is done correctly. Don't worry - we provide you with an easy to use JavaScript reporting library, meaning the average integration is only a few lines of code. It's super simple, just follow this instructions along, and you'll be on your way in no time.

> If you face any technical difficulties don't hesitate to contact your Stucco account manager and ask for technical assistance. 

### Setup ###

On every page that events should be reported from, paste the following HTML/JavaScript code between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    !function(s,t,u,c,c,o){if(s.mktag){return;}var a=["\x67\x63\x6c\x69\x64","\x6d\x73\x63\x6c\x6b\x69\x64"];
    var q=[];var c={q:q,event:function(e,n){q.push(["event", e, n])},setToken:function(e){s.mktag.partner_token=
    e},transform:function(d){d.visitor_id=s.mktag.mktag_visitor_id;if(window.mktag.mktag_visit_id_expires_at
    &&new Date()>new Date(window.mktag.mktag_visit_id_expires_at*1000)){window.mktag.mktag_visit_id='';}
    d.visit_id=s.mktag.mktag_visit_id;return d;},setAuto:function(m){s.mktag.auto=m}},sp=s.location
    .search.substring(1)===""?{}:JSON.parse('{"'+s.location.search.substring(1).replace(/&/g,'","').replace
    (/=/g,'":"')+'"}',function(e,n){return""===e?n:decodeURIComponent(n)}),p="",pn="";for(var i=0;i<a.length;i++)
    if(sp.hasOwnProperty(a[i])){p=sp[a[i]];pn=a[i];break}s.mktag=s.mktag||c;var d=t.createElement("script");
    d.async=!0,d.src=""===p?u:u+"?"+encodeURIComponent(pn)+"="+encodeURIComponent(p),t.head.appendChild(d);}
    (window,document,"https://r.stuccomedia.com/resource/mktag.js");

    mktag.setToken("<YOUR-PARTNER-TOKEN>");
    mktag.event("PageView");
</script>
```
> This default setup code fires the PageView event and should work for most sites. If your website is an _SPA_, please take a look at [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cs-event-tracking-spa.md %})

Whenever you need to report an event simply call:
```javascript
mktag.event("<EVENT_IDENTIFIER>", eventPropertiesObject);
```
