# Getting Started #
Just follow the guides below and you'll be up and running in no time!

### Event Tracking ###
Tracking user interactions on your site helps us scale up your traffic volume, improve conversion rates and identify relevant crowds outside of your existing user base. Implementing tracking is super simple - you can read more about it on the [Event Tracking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cs-event-tracking.md %}) page.

### Product Data Feed ###
Product data feeds are structured files containing information about the items you're selling. Setting up a feed delivery channel let's us keep close track of your stock and make real time changes to the traffic we're generating. We support multiple methods of feed delivery, including HTTP/S and FTP/S, with both push and pull models. We work with the highly popular Google Products feed structure, so chances are your data is already compliant - you can read a more about it on the [Product Data Feed Integration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link product-data-integration.md %}) page.
